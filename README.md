# Lenovo DMI Decryptor

Update: No full (16 mb) dump required anymore. Different file sizes work now

Drop Lenovo BIOS dump in the program. The program will close if it can't find 2 LENV blocks or if the dump is not 16 mb. Video tutorial: [Lenovo DMI Decryptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUXLHaK0CU8).
